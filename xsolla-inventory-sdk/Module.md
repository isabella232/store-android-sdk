# Module Xsolla Inventory SDK for Android

Allows working with in-game items using [Player Inventory](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/in-game-store/features/player-inventory/).

The entry point is the `XInventory` class. The library contains methods for working with the [Player Inventory API](https://developers.xsolla.com/store-api/player-inventory) and allows you to implement the following features:
*   user inventory
*   virtual currency balance
*   cross-platform inventory

The Inventory SDK can be used in combination with Store SDK or separately on platforms that restrict the use of third-party payment tools.
