## Overview

Xsolla Payments SDK is used to integrate Xsolla Pay Station into Android apps. Xsolla Pay Station allows partners to monetize their product by providing users with a convenient UI to pay for in-game purchases in the game store.

The following integration options are available:

*   Integration with **your server side** is suitable for partners who want to use Xsolla Pay Station with their own authentication method, in-game store, and player’s inventory.
*   Integration with **third-party service servers** is suitable for partners who already use third-party solutions to implement the server side, but want to use Xsolla Pay Station.
